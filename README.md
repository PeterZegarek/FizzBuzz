# FizzBuzz

## What is this project?

This project is a project that solves the famous **FizzBuzz** problem. The problem description is as follows:
Write a program that prints out every number between 1 and 100 (inclusive). If the number is divisible by 3, print out *Fizz* instead of the number. If the number is divisible by 5, print out *Buzz* instead of the number. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print out *FizzBuzz* instead of the number.

This program runs through the numbers from 1 to 100 and solves the problem stated above.
